# Class-AB Audio Power Amplifier

## 📄 Project Description

This project presents the design, simulation, and analysis of a Class-AB audio power amplifier, aimed at achieving an optimal balance between high efficiency and low distortion. The amplifier is implemented using a push-pull output stage with appropriate biasing to minimize crossover distortion while maintaining better efficiency than Class-A configurations.

The complete circuit is designed using discrete components and simulated to validate its functional performance. Simulation results demonstrate proper amplification, waveform integrity, and smooth transition between conduction regions of the output transistors. Key performance aspects such as voltage gain, output behavior, and signal fidelity are analyzed to verify correct Class-AB operation.

A major focus of this project is thermal behavior and stability. The impact of temperature variation on transistor characteristics is examined, highlighting the importance of biasing techniques in preventing thermal runaway and ensuring reliable long-term operation. This analysis reflects real-world design considerations commonly encountered in analog and audio power amplifiers.

In addition to simulation, the repository includes a **PCB schematic designed using KiCad**, translating the simulated circuit into a hardware-ready design. This allows the project to serve as a bridge between simulation and real-world implementation.

The project is intended as a practical learning resource for electronics students and enthusiasts, offering hands-on exposure to amplifier design, biasing strategies, circuit simulation, and PCB schematic development. It also serves as a foundational platform for extending into physical prototyping, efficiency optimization, or distortion analysis.

Overall, this project provides a clear demonstration of Class-AB amplifier principles, bridging theoretical concepts with practical simulation and PCB-level design.
